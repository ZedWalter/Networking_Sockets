# Overview

This is a program I wrote to learn more about client/server networking and about the use of sockets and the socket library within python.
The program starts by reserving a port on your computer and binding a socket to the port. From there the socket is put in listening mode and once you run the
client side of the program it establishes the connection witht he client and sends a message from the server to the client and then closes the connection.

# Network Communication

This program uses a server/client connection utilizing TCP and reserving port 12345 on your computer.
The only message sent is from the server to the client upon connecting and it sends the message "thank you for connecting" to the client.

# Development Environment

- VIsual Studio Code
- Git / Github
- Python
- Socket library

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* More communication between client/server instead of just a thank you message
* Add a small menu to recieve different messages from server
